**Project Goals:**

Short-term Focus: 
Given the upcoming General Elections on 8th June, this project will have a short term focus of analysing the historical general elections results in the UK with the aim of gaining insights from past data and conducting predictive modelling on the June elections.

Long-term Goal:
The aim is to provide a comprehensive suite of results and variables, both local and national, to construct a unique source of elections data for the UK. Currently election results, stats and analysis are stored in various data sources and reports which adds a layer of complexity for the public to parse through and gain useful insights. This project seeks to address this gap.

**Getting started:**
