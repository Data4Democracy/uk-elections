**Project Description:** This is a project set up to identify insights from analysis of UK election data.

**Project Goals:**

Short-term Focus: 
Given the upcoming General Elections on 8th June, this project will have a short term focus of analysing the historical general elections results in the UK with the aim of gaining insights from past data and conducting predictive modelling on the June elections.

Long-term Goal:
The aim is to provide a comprehensive suite of results and variables, both local and national, to construct a unique source of elections data for the UK. Currently election results, stats and analysis are stored in various data sources and reports which adds a layer of complexity for the public to parse through and gain useful insights. This project seeks to address this gap.

**Getting started:** 

1. Contributers are welcome to the Slack channel to add ideas and suggestions.
2. The Projects and Issues pages list work which needs to be done. As the project develops, this will keep growing so these are the best places to check out the evolving requirements. 
3. Everything on the project is open for discussion, so do shout on the Slack channel, or feel free to submit issues and pull requests, or comment on this repo. The best way to build a good data source for the public is to crowdsource ideas from the public!

# **UK Parliamentary General Elections**

The UK general elections analysis phase of this project will follow the general outline below. Details will be listed in the Issues/Projects pages.

**Stages:**

**1. Data collection**: Collecting historical general elections results and supporting data, starting with 2015 then working our way back in time.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identify variables to help with prediction and modelling of future/upcoming elections.

**3. Prediction/Modelling**: Explore different modelling options, such as a binary model that predicts the winner, with a degree of probability, using the 2015 model as a base/train model (potentially add the 2010 data to have more data to work with), or predicting a number of votes per party at constituency level.

**4. Data Visualisation**: Consider ways of displaying results, e.g. build dashboards, interactive visuals on a site, etc.
